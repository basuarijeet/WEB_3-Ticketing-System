# WEB_3-Ticketing-System By EventBear

This particular repo is a demonstation of how our NFT ticketing system would work in real life.

Due to the 48 hour time constraint, we could not completely implement our customised private polygon marketplace due to runtime errors in the solidity files. To demonstrate the same, we have linked it to OpenSea and listed a couple NFT's per event for Demo purposes only.
